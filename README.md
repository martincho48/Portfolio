## Projects
### Book Recommendation System
- Description: Add book you like and you get recommended similar books
- Technologies Used: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, Docker, GCP
- Link: https://github.com/martincho48/Portfolio/tree/master/Machine_Learning/app_book%20recommendation%20system

### End-to-End ML Pipeline - ongoing
- Description: Via API data are taken from a website in JSON format after that the data are cleaned and saved into PostgreSQL database. ML model takes the newest data from the database and after traning the model is exported in pkl format. The pkl model is used in a app created in Flask. This app is dockerized and uploaded on Google cloud. 
- Technologies Used: Python, Flask, Docker, GCP, PostgreSQL, Airflow, HTML, CSS
